# Project Innovating Media

Welcome to the comprehensive collection of LLLUF shots for the Learning Lab's Project Innovating Media (working title). 


For reference, we are working on a parallel project where faculty (who care a whole lot and have been trying really hard to come up with particularly cool things to do in their courses remotely) are recording themselves talking about one innovation they are excited to implement, and we at the LL are helping them create a cool video that highlights it! It started with this really amazing professor:


You may notice that one move we made to help create a professional, sizzling, slappin’ video was to start “in the real world” with a really neat shot that framed the phone playing the professor’s selfie video. Then we cut to his really nice stock b-roll media from his research. So by keeping the main story line in the “really nicely filmed” world and then referencing that more intimate, informal world of the phone selfie we helped to create an impressive but also relatable and human story.

So the mission for you, if you so choose, is to help make the student perspective of this type of thing...we know you don’t all have those insanely nice cameras...BUT where you can really help us out is in coming up with the shot ideas...so what is the setting that the phone sits in, how does it help to underscore the idea that is being shared?


Step 1> Record yourself for 1 minute, giving a manifesto/ a hope/ a dream/ a description of an innovation that would make you actually maybe a little excited about this weird remote learning time. If you have more than one idea, then feel free to create more 1 minute videos (but maybe move onto step 2 first).

Step 2> Choose a video (not your own) to edit. Please choose one that doesn’t have an editor yet before choosing one that someone else is already working on. If all of the videos in our list below have an editor assigned, then choose any that you are interested in. You can edit as many as you’d like! The idea here is to come up with some really cool mechanics for shooting your phone. Something that may be a challenge (or shall we say DESIGN CONSTRAINT!?...) is that you may only have your one phone...so how do you film your phone? Ok some ideas here (but don’t limit your own awesome creative problem solving skills!): Find a friend/family member whose phone you can borrow to give you two phone to work with (one as the video screen, and one as your camera), find a way to use your computer’s webcam as the camera...or play the video on your computer. Again, the focus here should be on the framing, the set up, etc. because we can recreate any of the shot ideas you generate with our nice cameras...that being said, it’s pretty important for you to include instructions on how you designed your shot! So please be generous with those! ;)

Jordan's Notes:
What makes it amazing:
* the globe idea is awesome, and could be especially effective for a class dealing with "global" issues! ;)
* also, the hand in the shot is something that we are kind of looking for, as it places the video in the context of a student watching it, which is sort of cool and meta.
