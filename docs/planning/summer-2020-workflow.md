# SUMMER 2020 WORKFLOW


## KEY TOOLS
### Slack
Nearly all Summer 2020 communication (all discussions, news, links, etc) should go to `#ll-summer-2020` unless it's really obviously connected to an already existing thematic channel (`#ll-reality-lab`, `#ll-music-lab`, etc).

And we should try to use some Slack apps we build this summer to automate ways in and out of Slack, connecting it to the other tools in this list.

### Github

Let's go with one big repo: [summer-2020](https://github.com/learninglab-dev/summer-2020/tree/master/public/people). We'll do this in the learninglab-dev team account so that everyone on that team can have write access.  This means that it will be won't be terribly secure, but let's cope with this by encouraging people to add new stuff in just two zones for now:

1. add all markdown files to the `/docs` folder (but go crazy with subfolders)
2. 


### google drive


### airtable

views
* express app
    * that pulls from airtable
    * and from markdown in docs folder of repo
    * and web stuff from public folder of repo
